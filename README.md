**TO DO FOR FIRST RELEASE:**
Finish up adding the first GDI and NOD Subfactions (Forgotten is already done)
Fix some more bugs
Polish up some icons

**Q/A:**
Q: Will you be adding the Scrin?
A: No, only because CA spend their hard time with adding the scrin in themselves, so even if they said yes I still wouldn't put them in

Q: What are your plans?
A: This is kinda a long one but I would like to add some CNC3 and CNC4 stuff into the mod (Which I am starting on CNC3), and I would love
to get some tech buildings but the person doing the great TS/RA2 conversions hasn't updated them yet.
